# Bluesky

In Bluesky, the player controls a head that appears in the center of the screen. The player can move the ship left, right, up and down with the arrow keys.  The player starts the game with three lives. When the game begins, a fleet of hot dogs appears randomly on the screen.  The hot dogs move in random directions and bounce off the edge of the screen.  The player attempts to collide with all of the hot dogs, thus eating them and scoring points. A bowl of kimchi appears in one of the four corners of the screen at the beginning of the game as well.  The bowl of kimchi follows the player around the screen, and if it collides with the player, the player loses one life and the hot dog fleet and kimchi reset.  If the player successfully eats all the hot dogs, the game levels up.  The screen repopulates with hot dogs and kimchi, and the player, hot dogs and kimchi all increase in speed. The game is over when the player runs out of lives.
